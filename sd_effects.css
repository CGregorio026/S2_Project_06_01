The background is set to an image using the url, and it is fixed so it does not change within the page when scrolling. The size is set to 100% to fit the entire page.

/* 
I put this here when editing the background above, because I wanted to see what it would look like without the body content in the way.

    This next step took a lot of experimenting to get right, due to the coordinates and the stopping of colors. The syntax is the shape, a position, and colors. Putting the percentages after the colors is where it would stop on the page.

Filter here changes the shadow and adds grayscale and opacity. Because some browsers do not support filter alone, I put in the webkit to ensure that it would change in the webpage. I also rotated the image by changing it on the y.
